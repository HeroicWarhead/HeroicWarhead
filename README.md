## Hi there ðŸŒ•ðŸ’™ 

You can call me **Al / Alto / Zed** or any other name you know I go by. I mainly use **He/Him** but **Zem/It** is fine too. I go to college for computer science and creating things is my hobby. AKA Why my github is not my normal username. **I am 21+.** 

If I don't respond in game, I am most like writing or drawing! Feel free to whisper me and I'll get back whenever <3. If you wanna chat about persona I would loveee to. 

**The only DNI I have is if you are one to judge others for what they like, even if you deem it as "problematic".** Of course, like normal, if you are homophobic, racist, etc, I will not interact with you.
